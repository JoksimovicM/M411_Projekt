# Sorter_Comparison
This program takes sets of numbers and sorts them using different sorting algorithms. The number sets are either in random order, partially sorted or reverse partially sorted. It measures sort duration in ms, memory usage in bytes, number of comparisons and number of write accesses and stores them in a csv.
